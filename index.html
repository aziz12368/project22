 <p>The company was incorporated as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space
   <br>
 Company (EADS) in the year 2000 through the merger of the French
 <br>
 Aérospatiale-Matra, the German DASA and Spanish CASA. The new entity
 <br>
subsequently acquired full ownership of its subsidiary, Airbus Industrie GIE, a joint
<br>
 venture of European aerospace companies originally incorporated in 1970 to
 <br>
 develop and produce a wide-body aircraft to compete with American-built
 <br>
 >airliners. EADS rebranded itself as Airbus SE in 2015. Reflecting its multinational
 <br>
origin, the company operates major offices and assembly plants in France.

      The Airbus family of aircraft includes a variety
      <br>
       of models designed to meet different market
       <br>
        needs, from single-aisle to widebody aircraft. 
        <br>
        Heres a brief overview:
        <br>
      Single-Aisle Aircraft
      <br>
      <br>
      A220: Designed for the 100 to 150-seat market,
      <br>
       the A220 offers efficiency and comfort for 
       <br>
       short to medium-haul flights1.
       <br>
      A320 Family: This includes the A318, A319, A320,
      <br>
       and A321 models. The A320neo
       <br>
       
        (New Engine Option) versions are known for 
        <br>
        their fuel efficiency and reduced emissions2.

<p class="final">
   The Airbus A380 is a very large wide-body
   <br>
    airliner developed and produced by Airbus.
    <br>
     It is the world's largest passenger airliner
     <br>
      and the only full-length double-deck jet airliner.
      <br>
       Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project
       <br>
        was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance 
        <br>
        of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. 
   <br>
        The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; 
        <br>
        Airbus launched the €9.5–billion ($10.7–billion) A380 
        <br>
      
<br>
<br>
   Due to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial
    production was delayed by two years and the development 
    costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore 
    Airlines on 15 October 2007

      The Airbus A300-600ST (Super Transporter),
      <br>
       or Beluga, is a specialised wide-body airliner
       <br>
        used to transport aircraft parts and outsize
        <br>
         cargoes. It received the official name of Super 
         <br>
         Transporter early on, but its nickname, after the
         <br>
          beluga whale, which it resembles,gained
          <br>
          vr
          <br>
           popularity and has since been officially adopted.
           <br>
<br>
      Due to Airbus's manufacturing facilities being dispersed,
      <br>
       the company had a long term need to transport sizeable components,
       <br>
        such as wings and fuselage sections, to their final assembly lines
        <br>

      The Airbus A320 family is a series of
      <br>
       narrow-body airliners developed 
       <br>
       and produced by Airbus. The A320 was launched 
       <br>
       in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987
       <br>
       , and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France.
       <br>
       The first member of the family was followed by the
       <br>
        stretched A321 (first delivered in January 1994),
        <br>
         the shorter A319 (April 1996), and the even shorter
         <br>
          A318 (July 2003). Final assembly takes place in Toulouse 
          <br>
          in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China since 2009;
          <br>
           and Mobile, Alabama in the United States since April 2016.
